============

Example Secure Implementation of [VGS](https://www.verygoodsecurity.com) 
in Ruby on Rails using [VGS Collect](https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/features/vgs-collect) library. 
Follow the instructions below to see how VGS Collect works. 

As part of the payment submission, the stripe gem goes through 
the VGS Proxy via environment configurations - this is shown in .env.sample.
If both of those are filled out this will run smoothly create a record 
"fake charge a card in stripes API sandbox" and show you how it will work on your apps.
